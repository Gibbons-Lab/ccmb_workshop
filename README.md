# Data and Materials for CCMB workshop 2018

You can see the actual workshop walkthrough at
http://gibbons-lab.github.io/ccmb_workshop. A [PDF version](workshop.pdf)
(lacks the output previews) is also available.

All output generated during the walkthrough can be found in the
[treasure chest](treasure_chest). The easiest way to get all of that
is to [download the entire repository](https://github.com/Gibbons-Lab/ccmb_workshop/archive/master.zip).
